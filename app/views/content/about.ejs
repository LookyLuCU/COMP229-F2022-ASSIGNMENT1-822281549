<!--Infomration about me-->
<p style="padding: 0 px 30px 0px 20px;">
    I am a soon to be graduate of the Software Engineering Technology Program with Centennial College and a previous graduate of both Materials and Operations Management and Office Admnistration Programs from Conestoga College.
    <br><br>
    My dream is to gain the skill needed to design and develop user friendly, intuitive, and well-rounded Enterprise Resource Planning Software (ERP). I am currently starting my 2nd year of the Software Engineering Technology program at Centennial College. I will also be exploring AI elements of my program to see if I can take it a step further to develop a sort of intuitive software changeover product to make the current 3-year manual program upgrades into a smoother automated process. 
    <br><br>
    I enjoy leading and managing projects, working with and elevating team members, get a real thrill out of seeing ideaâ€™s come to life, and believe that everyting is possible.
